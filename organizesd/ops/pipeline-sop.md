# Applicant Pipeline SOP (Rolling Admissions)

## Stages
1. **New** (unreviewed)
2. **Screen** (basic eligibility + completeness)
3. **Interview Scheduled**
4. **Interviewed**
5. **Accepted**
6. **Waitlist**
7. **Declined**
8. **Confirmed** (accepted + logistics confirmed)

## Service level
- Every applicant receives an acknowledgement within **48 hours**.

## Weekly rhythm
- **2 screen blocks/week** (e.g., Tue + Fri)
- **1–2 interview blocks/week** (stack interviews back-to-back)
- **Pipeline meeting (30 min)** weekly to review:
  - total apps; stage counts
  - conversion (app→interview; interview→accept)
  - representation gaps by region/campus/community
  - outstanding follow-ups older than 48h

## Notes
- Keep the public application short; use interviews for depth.
- Document every decision with a brief reason (future-proofing + fairness).
