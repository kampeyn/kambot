This file captures the current campus-forward advertising plan components.

## 1) Physical presence & advertising

  - 1920×1080 graphics focused on “The Power of the 605”
- Academic halls: bulletins in Political Science & Leadership departments
  - QR code → Organize SD Fellowship application
- College radio: KUSD (Vermillion) + KSDJ (Brookings)
  - 15-second spots: “Pierre makes the rules. You can change them.”
- Newspapers: The Volante + The Collegian
  - quarter-page “letter to editor” style issue framing
- Expos: student org fairs + civic engagement days
  - pull-up banners + laptop stickers

## 2) Institutional outreach (Deans & leadership)
Targets:
- College of Arts & Sciences
- Leadership programs (SDSU LeadState, USD Farber Center)

Action:

## 3) Canva infographic strategy

## 4) Outreach assets
