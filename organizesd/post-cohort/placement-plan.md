# Post-Cohort Placement + Support Plan

## Goals (60–90 days)
- Place or engage **50–70%** of graduates into an organizing role, volunteer leadership role, or campaign/community placement.

## Support model
- Monthly office hours (standing time)
- Alumni Telegram channel for opportunities
- Light coaching: 1:1 check-ins for those who request help

## Placement pipeline
- Maintain a list of partner campaigns/orgs with needs
- Use a standard intro email template (graduate → partner)
- Track placements + outcomes (date, role, partner feedback)

## Metrics to track
- Placement/engagement rate
- Retention/continued activity at 30/60/90 days
- Alumni satisfaction + coaching utilization
- Lessons learned to improve next cohort
