# Organize SD — One-pager (draft)

## What Organize SD is
**Organize SD** is a South Dakota-based training initiative that strengthens the Democratic ecosystem by developing **high-skill grassroots operatives** who can build and run effective organizing programs across federal, state, and local races.

## Mission
Train a new generation of South Dakota organizers and campaign operatives in **grassroots movement-building best practices** so local teams can scale voter contact, volunteer power, and turnout.

## What OSD will do
### Operative training (core)
- Live and virtual trainings on **grassroots organizing fundamentals**
- Best-practice playbooks for **field, volunteer, and community organizing**
- Systems for sustainable programs (not one-off events)

### Curriculum topics (examples)
- Turf plans, universes, and contact goals
- Volunteer recruitment, onboarding, retention, and leadership ladders
- Door/phone/text scripts that convert conversations into action
- Event-driven + relational organizing
- Data hygiene, follow-up systems, accountability rhythms
- Field management basics: staffing, QA, training, reporting
- Coalition and relationship building
- Compliance-aware basics (what to avoid; how to stay independent)

### Coaching + support
- Office hours/coaching for trainees and local leaders
- Templates: volunteer tracking, training agendas, turf packets
- Peer network to share learnings

## What OSD will not do
- Not a campaign; does not replace campaign field teams
- Not primarily running daily canvassing operations
- Does not manage campaigns’ internal data/targeting/paid media

## Who this is for
- First-time and rising organizers
- Field directors, deputy FDs, regional organizers
- Volunteer leaders + community connectors
- Down-ballot campaigns that need field capacity fast

## Success by Nov 2026
- More trained operatives placed on campaigns and community programs
- Stronger volunteer programs and leadership pipelines statewide
- Higher-quality voter contact (and more of it) across the ballot

## Structure + compliance (high-level)
OSD is designed as a **training-first political organization** focused on building Democratic grassroots capacity in SD. Given the explicitly electoral, Democratic-only training mission, OSD is intended to operate as a **Section 527 political organization**.

Guardrails:
- Training-first scope
- No candidate contributions
- Independence + disclaimers if candidate-referencing comms ever occur
- Operational discipline (documentation, trainer guidelines, financial controls)
