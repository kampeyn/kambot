# Curriculum Outline (v1) — Mar 27–29, 2026

Design principle: fewer modules, more practice. Aim for 6–8 modules total.

## Proposed modules
1. **Organizing fundamentals**: power, structure, goals, accountability
2. **Turf + universes**: setting targets, daily goals, reporting
3. **Recruitment + onboarding**: how to get the *second shift* (return volunteers)
4. **Persuasion conversations**: door/phone/text roleplays + handling objections
5. **Follow-up systems**: tracking, re-recruiting, relational organizing basics
6. **Field QA + coaching**: what good looks like, feedback loops, data hygiene
7. **Event-driven organizing**: how to run a meeting that converts to action
8. **Compliance-aware basics**: guardrails, what to avoid, independence norms

## Deliverables trainees should leave with
- A personal organizing plan (who/where/how many contacts)
- A volunteer ladder template + recruitment script
- A basic turf plan + daily goals worksheet
- A follow-up tracker template

## Evaluation
- Participation + attendance
- Roleplay competence (basic rubric)
- Professionalism + coachability
