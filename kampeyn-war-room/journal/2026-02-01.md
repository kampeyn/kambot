## Session Overview
Tonight's session focused on infrastructure setup: switching the primary AI model to Kimi (Moonshot) and implementing Firecrawl as a custom search skill.

## Key Activities

### 1. Kimi (Moonshot) Integration
- **Goal**: Make Kimi K2.5 the primary reasoning/chat model
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Configuration**:
  - Primary model: `moonshot/kimi-k2.5` (alias: `kimi`)
  - Fallbacks: `openai-codex/gpt-5.2`, `openai/gpt-5.2`
  - API key: Moved to env var `${MOONSHOT_API_KEY}` (security)
- **Result**: I am now running on Kimi as the primary model

### 2. Firecrawl Custom Skill
- **Goal**: Implement web search via Firecrawl API
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Implementation**:
  - Created custom skill at `/home/clawd/.clawdbot/skills/firecrawl/`
  - Provides `firecrawl_search` tool (calls Firecrawl `/v1/search`)
  - Supports optional scraping to markdown
  - API key: Uses `${FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}` env var
- **Why not built-in**: Clawdbot's `web_search` is limited to Brave/Perplexity; Firecrawl requires custom implementation

### 3. Security Hardening
- **Issue**: Moonshot API key was hardcoded in config file
- **Fix**: Replaced with `${MOONSHOT_API_KEY}` placeholder
- **Gateway setup**: Environment variables passed via tmux session startup
- **Verification**: Config file now uses placeholder; runtime uses actual key

### 4. Memory System Enhancements
- Enabled `compaction.memoryFlush` (memory writes before compaction)
- Enabled `memorySearch.experimental.sessionMemory` (index session transcripts)
- Created `MEMORY.md` for long-term curated context

## Decisions Made
1. **Kimi as primary**: Better reasoning for political consulting work
2. **Firecrawl over Gemini**: More control over search + scrape pipeline
3. **Env var pattern**: All secrets externalized; config file is safe to view

## Open Items
- [ ] Build Kampeyn War Room (Next.js app for document viewer)
- [ ] Build Organize SD War Room (dashboard for cohort tracking)
- [ ] Implement auto-journal creation (this doc was manual)
- [ ] Set up nightly cron for automatic doc updates

## Notes
- User timezone: America/Chicago (Sioux Falls until April)
- Gateway runs in tmux session at `/tmp/clawdbot-tmux-sockets/clawdbot.sock`
- Current time: 05:20 UTC / 11:20 PM CST
