# 90-Day Goals (Lenox)

Time horizon: next 90 days

## Goals
1) **$10,000 MRR** from **3–4 clients**
2) **Launch Organize SD cohort**
   - Success metric: **10 apps/week** or **50+ apps by deadline**
   - Cohort size target: **15–20**
3) **Launch product apps**
   - **Thank Donors**
   - **Hiring Blue**

## Core offer to productize (reduce Lenox hands-on time)
- Fundraising consulting:
  - Call time management
  - Email fundraising
  - Event management

## Implications for how we work
- Build repeatable delivery systems (SOPs + templates + checklists) so execution can be delegated.
- Use War Rooms to track priorities, owners, and progress (client work + Organize SD + product builds).
