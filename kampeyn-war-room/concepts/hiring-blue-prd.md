# PRD — Hiring Blue (v1)

## Problem
Campaigns struggle to hire quickly (field/fundraising/comms) and to manage applicants consistently.

## Goal
A lightweight hiring pipeline for campaigns with templates, intake, and a clear process.

## Target users
- Campaign managers / ops
- Consultants coordinating hiring for multiple campaigns

## MVP Scope
**Must-have**
- Job template generator (role description + requirements)
- Applicant intake (form → table)
- Stage pipeline (new → screen → interview → offer → hired/declined)
- Email templates (reach-out, rejection, scheduling)
- Simple dashboard metrics (apps/week, stage conversion)

**Nice-to-have (later)**
- Calendar scheduling integration
- Reference check workflow
- Candidate scoring rubric

## Workflow
1) Create job posting from template
2) Collect applicants
3) Move through stages with notes
4) Use email templates for communication
5) Track metrics

## Success metrics
- Time-to-fill
- Apps/week
- Conversion rate from screen → interview → hire
