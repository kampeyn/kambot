# PRD — Thank Donors (v1)

## Problem
Campaigns and orgs lose retention and future giving because donor thank-you workflows are inconsistent, slow, and not personalized.

## Goal
Make it easy to send timely, personalized donor thank-yous (email/SMS) and track completion.

## Target users
- Small campaigns with limited staff
- Fundraising consultants managing multiple clients

## MVP Scope
**Must-have**
- Import donors (CSV)
- Rules-based segmentation (amount, first-time vs repeat, recency)
- Template library (thank-you variants)
- Generate/send drafts (email first; SMS optional)
- Task tracking: "sent" / "needs follow-up" / "bounced"
- Simple reporting dashboard

**Nice-to-have (later)**
- ActBlue/WinRed integrations
- Handwritten note workflow
- A/B testing

## Workflow
1) Import donors
2) Choose campaign/org + configure sender
3) Pick template + personalize tokens
4) Review queue
5) Send (or export)
6) Track outcomes

## Success metrics
- Time-to-thank-you reduced (<24–48h)
- % donors thanked
- Repeat giving lift (later)

## Open questions
- Email sending: Gmail draft-only vs direct send?
- Data sources: ActBlue export format assumptions
