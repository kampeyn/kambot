# Decision — Priority Order (next 90 days)

Date: 2026-02-01

## Decision
Work priorities are, in order:
1) **A — $10k MRR packaging + sales assets**
2) **C — Thank Donors + Hiring Blue PRDs/MVP plans**
3) **B — Organize SD War Room + apps pipeline**

## Rationale
- Revenue and productized service packaging reduces Lenox time and increases capacity.
- Product apps should be scoped and launched with clear MVPs after revenue packaging is underway.
- Organize SD execution remains important but follows after A and C.
