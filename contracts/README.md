# Contracts

Store client contracts + scope documents here.

## Structure
- `clients/<client_slug>/`
  - `contract/` (signed agreement, amendments)
  - `scope/` (SOWs, pricing, deliverables)
  - `compliance/` (deadlines, reporting rules, state/local notes)
  - `notes/` (anything operational)

Tip: use `client_slug` to match `emails/clients/<client_slug>`.
